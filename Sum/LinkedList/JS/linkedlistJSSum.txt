Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
==================================

1. prev.next = cur means we did not find any duplicates for this element, so we can safely move the prev to next element 
2. since it did not say it is sorted in ascending or descending order, so we need to specify !== do not use < or > in case you do not know the order
