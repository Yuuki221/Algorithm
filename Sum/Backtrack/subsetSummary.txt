Subset Summarization 

1. Subset I 
> there is no duplicates in number collection 

you put [] first, then for every older subresults in the final result collection,
you copy the whole old collection  
you add new number to the copied old results, 
at the end of iteration throught all old result for this number, you add them back to the current result. 
Repeat the process 


2. Subset II 
> there may be duplicates in number collection 

> Similar to Combination, this time you do not need to check the restriction condition, you add it everytime you 
get a new result. 

> need to deal with duplicates, 
> you sort, 
> you skip the duplicates in while loop
