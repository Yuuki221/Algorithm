# Dynamic Programming 

---

## Some thoughs

What is the current situation/result depends on -> make the step clear out
Dynamic Programming usually require more space complexity compare to other method

## Applied in Design

1. [Range Sum Query](./rangesumqueryimmutable.js)

  *the query will be called many times and we need a way to access the result quicker*
  
## Reduce Space useage 

1. [Maximum Square](./maximumsquare.js)

### [House Robber](./houserobber.js)
  
  *current satus depends on previous include or exclude, and its own status has include and exlclude*
  
### [Climbing Stairs](./climbingstairs.js)

  *how do we reach current step, from previous several conditions*
